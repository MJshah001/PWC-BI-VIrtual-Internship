# PWC-BI-Virtual-Internship
This repository contains the Power BI Dashboards I created during the PWC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation on Forage - August 2024

 * Completed a job simulation where I strengthened my PowerBI skills to better understand clients and their data visualisation needs.
 * Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, showcasing the ability to respond to client requests with well-designed solutions.
 * Strong communication skills reflected in the concise and informative email communication with engagement partners, delivering valuable insights and actionable suggestions based on data analysis.
 * Leveraged analytical problem-solving skills to examine HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and identified root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level, highlighting a commitment to data-driven decision-making.
